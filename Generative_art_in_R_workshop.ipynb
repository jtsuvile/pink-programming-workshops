You're welcome to follow along the workshop as is, but if you're keen to go faster and try out more things, you can also try your hand at exercises below. \n",

        "2. Indentation doesn't matter for code execution.\n",

        "4. The 'magrittr pipe'` %>%` (part of tidyverse family of packages; here imported via the package dplyr) is used to combine multiple commands to a sequence. It works similarly to a | pipe on the command line or '.' in pandas: it takes the output of the left hand side of the pipe and feeds it as the first parameter to the function on the right hand side of the pipe.\n",
        "5. Many of the plotting libraries used for generating art build on something called \"Grammar of Graphics\" (package ggplot2). Here, the different \"layers\" (e.g. type of plot, data to be mapped, text overlaid on plot) are combined via a plus sign (`+`). [Here is a short intro to grammar of graphics](http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/classes/STAT4580-2022/ggplot.html) and [here is a much longer one](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html) - or you could just try to google examples and test those out.\n",
        "6. Vectors are created with the function `c()` (c stands for combine). Vectors can contain strings or numbers, but if you try to create a vector with both strings and numbers, the numbers will get converted to strings.\n",

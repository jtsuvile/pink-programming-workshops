# pink-programming-workshops

This repo contains teaching materials I have developed for Pink Programming activities, e.g. workshops that I have led. These consist of: 

1. [Code](https://github.com/jtsuvile/pink-programming-workshops/blob/main/Generative_art_in_R_workshop.ipynb) and [slides](https://github.com/jtsuvile/pink-programming-workshops/blob/main/Workshop%20generative%20art%20with%20R.pdf) for a beginner-friendly workshop on **making generative art using R**. The notebook should be run in an R-runtime on Colab. How to check if you're in an R or Python runtime is explained at the top of the notebook. Beware that some of the package installations in section "Setting up your R environment" can take a pretty long time (around 30 mins).
